XPathScript
===========================

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

   
During installation, Makefile.PL will check if it should use XML::LibXML 
or XML::XPath as the default xml parser. if you want to force XPathScript to use 
one or the other, do

	perl Makefile.PL -parser=XML::LibXML
	or
	perl Makefile.PL -parser=XML::XPath


XPS comes with its AxKit language module. Not to clash with the 
Apache::AxKit::Language::XPathScript.pm bundled with AxKit, it is named
Apache::AxKit::Language::YPathScript.pm. To use this module under AxKit, 
add the following to your httpd.conf (the first two lines are probably 
already present):

	PerlModule AxKit
	AddHandler AxKit .xml
	AxAddStyleMap application/x-ypathscript Apache::AxKit::Language::YPathScript

And to your .htaccess something like:

	<AxStyleName "#default">
	   AxAddProcessor application/x-ypathscript your_stylesheet.xps
	</AxStyleName>
